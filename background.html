      <p>The biggest misconception that consumers have is thinking that overconsumption is only bad sometimes. However, the sad reality of fast, unsustainable fashion is that at every stage of a garment life cycle causes suffering to workers, consumers and the environment. It’s a game where everyone loses.</p>

        <h4>RAW MATERIALS</h4>
        <p>Most raw materials used to fuel the textile industry comes from developing countries with little regulation on how to sustainably harvest resources; including natural fabrics like cotton and synthetic ones such as polyester. This results in environmental damage as well as use of exploitative labour to harvest and/or make the raw materials. </p>

        <h4>MANUFACTURING</h4>
        <p>Most garments are made by cheap labour mainly from developing countries or marginalised groups in developed countries. Workers are made to endure grueling work in poor conditions for wages that can’t sustain life.</p>

        <h4>CONSUMPTION</h4>
        <p>Overconsumption has a negative impact on consumers’ mental health. Overconsumption ties a person’s identity to the products they own causing them to consume more to feel like they are worth more. Financial strain, buyer’s remorse and hoarding are just a few of the effects of overconsumption. </p>

        <h4>WASTE</h4>
        <p>The textile industry produces waste that takes centuries to decay, leading to the piling up of old, discarded garments that pollute the environment at an alarming rate. </p>
